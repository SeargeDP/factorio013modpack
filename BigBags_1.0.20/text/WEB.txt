[spoiler=Description][b][size=150]Description[/size][/b]
For those who can lift heavy luggages, this mod increases the size of all your bags (main inventory, toolbelt, logistics slots, trash slots).

Extra inventory sizes are available via a dedicated technology.
Extra toolbelts and slots are accessible via more technology upgrades (extra-tiers).
There are also extra-tiers for robot storage and robot speed.
There is a technology to increase reach distance and other pickup distances, with several tiers.

Note that you still have to research for Logistic Robotics, initial Character Logistic Slots and initial Trash Slots to enable further tiers.

Independantly of any research, it can also increases the default stack size for every item, and default magazine size for every ammo.
And it also can set default request amount for logistic slots to 1 to avoid ordering a bunch of robots every time your enter a new item in the logistic slots.
Nothing is mandatory or fixed, so you can customize all these last "unresearched" features by editing or commenting the self-explanatory config.lua file.
Comment the features you don't want...
