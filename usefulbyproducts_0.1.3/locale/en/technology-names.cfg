[technology-description]
fuel-cell=Store hydrogen in a hydrogen fuel cell.
caustic-refining=Sodium hydroxide can be used for caustic washing of crude oil to make the refining process more efficient.
advanced-caustic-refining=Sodium hydroxide can be used for caustic washing in more advanced oil processes.
caustic-washing=Sodium hydroxide can be used for caustic washing of slurry to make the filtration process more efficient.
caustic-washing-thermal=Sodium hydroxide can be used for caustic washing of thermal water to make the filtration process more efficient.
