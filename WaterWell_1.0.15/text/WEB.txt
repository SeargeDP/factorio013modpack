Even when you are under the heavy sun of a desert land, there is always water somewhere under your feet... So use this water well pump to find it !

This pump produces a maximum of 100 water per second and consumes 100kW.

The recipe to build this pump just requires steel processing technology and is available at the early stages of the game.
