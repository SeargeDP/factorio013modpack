A tank mod that adds additional tanks and tank/vehicle features to factorio.

Adds:
Tanks
- Auto cannon tank, fast conventional tank with two tiers
- Flamer tank, fast flamer tank with two tiers
- Super tank, heavy all round tank
- Rocket tank, Fast mobile range rocket launcher (under going redesign)

Features
- Recall to tank teleporter tokens

Tank guns
- Auto cannon, will pass through objects like butter
- Battle cannon, stronger explosive shells
- Flamer, flame-thrower with two modes of fire
- Artillery, slow, high damage and long range shells
- Rocket launcher, fast and long range rockets
- Mine layer, faster way to deploy mines
- Machine gun, stronger then vanilla

Turrets
- Cannon turret, a flame-thrower turret (under development)

Dependencies:
This mod can be used with vanilla only, however it is balanced to play multi-player with "Bob's Enemies" and "Natural Evolution Expansion". This mod might be overpowered for vanilla Factorio.

Updates:
V1.4.1
- Added recall teleporter token, for speedy return to your tank of your selection
- Added gun turrets (under development) allows you to arm turrets with tank ammo. Atm I disabled all turrets except flame-thrower.  
- Rebalanced: Artillery tank gun, now shoots less far and accurate. Now launches 4 shells.
- Recommendation, create backup save if you already had a game in progress. This update contains a lot of balancing changes in damage and production.

v1.3.0
- First public release

Note:
I have not been able to succeed to build a rocket playing this with two people with "Bob's Enemies" and "Natural Evolution Expansion". Around 80% evolution it starts to get really rough.

This mod formerly also included a mod to increase concrete and rail production. This has been split into its own mod that you can download from:
