[technology-description]
modular-tank-research = Allows construction of Battle Tanks with different turret configurations on same chassis.
modular-tank-research2 = Allows construction of W.L.S.K (Wild Life Survival Kit) to improve armour of Battle Tanks.
modular-tank-research3 = Allows construction of support tanks, Minelayer and a Rapid Firing Rocket Launcher system.
mechanized-infantry-research = Allows construction of box magazines with large capacity to be used with Infantry or Vehicle mounted weapons. Also Fish Kits.
new-munitions = Allows construction of chemical weapons. Normally banned, but screw the nature. After all what was the last nice thing nature did for you?
organic-explosives = A rather painful method of extracting required metarials for Heavy Ordinance Charges from wood and stone instead of petrol products.
super-tank-research = Allows construction of components and assembly of Heavy Battle Tanks, the ultimate gas guzzlers and gun shooters.
super-tank-research2 = Allows construction of Heavy Battle Tanks with Windlass Mass Desyncronizer Cannon mounted. There is no reason other then pure hatred to drive one around.
