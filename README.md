Github suggested that adding a readme file would make it easier for people to understand the purpose of this repository, so I added this readme file.

You can create a new world with custom settings, but I recommend to use the save file SeargeModPackWorld.zip in this pack for a well balanced experience. To use it, copy the zip file from the _world folder in this pack into you saves folder of Factorio.
