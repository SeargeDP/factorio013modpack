		apply_when_object_exists (optional):   Exclusions will only be applied when an object of the specified type and name is found ( in data.raw[type][name] ).

			name

		excluded_prototype_names (optional):   (array) Individual prototypes which should not be altered e.g "small-pump" or "steam-engine".

		excluded_prototype_types (optional):   (array) Types of prototypes which should not be altered e.g "pump" or "generator".
		                                       All prototypes from all mods of the types specified will be excluded from alteration.
		                                       Meaning if you exclude "pump" no pumps will have their collision boxes changed.
